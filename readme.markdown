## What is this about?
Learn Polymorphism is all about creating a simple and easy to understand way for people (and students) to learn and understand polymorphism.

## Background
I have been a TA for CS 1331 at the Georgia Institute of Technology for several semesters and have seen that students have struggled with learning polymorphism. I know this on hand as I first struggled with polymorphism. The entire idea and initial design was all based off of a homework a friend had to do for a class. I've taken the idea and run with it a bit.
